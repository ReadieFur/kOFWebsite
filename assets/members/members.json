We were just few players with a clan tag infront of our names.<br>kOF's first name was Kings of Fortnite, since we were that good to win any game we wanted back in the day, but a year ago we changed it to Knockout Force, feel like it was more professional that way.<br>I work in a different city from my hometown so mostly I can't play like I've done in the past, but often I enjoy playing CS:GO, Dota 2, used to play Black Ops IV a lot, and so on.<br>I was a big Rust fan, still am, but got no time to play it actively.<br>My job is producing, directing, and editing videos, and I do marketing on the side as well. 23 years of age.",

I usually play CSGO/Valorant, but back in the days i used to play GTA San Andreas and League of Legends too.<br>I am one of the Founders of the community we are building and real life friend with Notorious KING. The reason we are dedicating so much time and effort is because we all have the same passion for gaming. We love working on new things which would help our community grow further.<br>I hope you will enjoy what we build over the next years, because we are just getting started.",
